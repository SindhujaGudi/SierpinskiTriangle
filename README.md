# SierpinskiTriangle

We're going to use what we've been learning to draw a famous fractal: the Sierpinski triangle. You'll need to implement the following steps:

Make certain that your application specifies a WIDTH of 1024 and a HEIGHT of 768 for the Canvas.
Create six variables to represent three vertices: (512,109), (146,654), and (876,654). I recommend storing these as (x1,y1), (x2,y2), and (x3,y3).
Create another pair of variables which will store the "current" point. You should really call them x and y. Start x at 512, and start y at 382.
Then, in a loop that repeats 50,000 times:
Draw the current point on the screen by using the following line of code: g.drawLine(x,y,x,y);
(optional) Delay for a bit using Thread.sleep()
Have the computer choose a random number from 1 to 3
If the random number was a 1, find the distance between (x,y) and (x1,y1)
(You can find the x-distance (which I call dx) by subtracting x - x1, and you can find dy in a similar way.)
If the random number was a 2, find the distance between (x,y) and (x2,y2)
If the random number was a 3, find the distance between (x,y) and (x3,y3)
Move the "current" point half the distance to the chosen vertex like so: x = x - dx/2; and (similarly) y = y - dy/2;
Again, all of this is in a loop that repeats 50,000 times or so.
(optional) Once the loop ends, draw the string "Sierpinski Triangle" at (462,484) or so.
